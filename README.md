# Image to LaTeX with attention

## Problem Description
LaTeX is a software system for document preparation. It is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields. But preparation materials using LaTeX requires from the writer a lot of time and effort. So, the problem of image-to-markup generation is solved in this work. Images with formula are translated to LATEX code. The proposed model is based on the Vision Encoder Decoder architecture.
