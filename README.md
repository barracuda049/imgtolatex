# Image to LaTeX with attention

## Problem Description
LaTeX is a software system for document preparation. It is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields. But preparation materials using LaTeX requires from the writer a lot of time and effort. So, the problem of image-to-markup generation is solved in this work. Images with formula are translated to LATEX code. The proposed model is based on the Vision Encoder Decoder architecture.

## Dataset Description
We use the following publicly available [I2L-140K dataset](TBA) for image to LaTeX problem.

I2L-140K dataset is a collection of images of LaTeX formulas and LaTeX formulas themselves. Some samples from
dataset are presented below. Dataset contains a total of 154,944 images and LaTeX formulas. LaTeX formulas
length is varied from 1 to 2177 symbols. Each image in the dataset is a 1-channel image with a resolution that depends on the length of the formula and varies from 3 × 3 pixels to 1020 × 644 pixels.
